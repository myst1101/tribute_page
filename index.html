            <figcaption id="img-caption">Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory
                of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. His work is also known for its influence on the
                philosophy of science.</figcaption>

            <p>This is a timeline of the big moments in his life:</p>

                    mysteries of the natural world.</li>
                <li><strong>1889:</strong> Settles into a program of self-education at age 10 and begins reading as much
                    about science as he can.</li>
                <li><strong>1894:</strong> Stays on in Munich to finish the school year after his parents move to Pavia,
                    Italy.

                    top technical university, but fails the arts portion. His family sends him to the Swiss town of Aarau

                <li><strong>1905:</strong> Publishes, at age 26, five groundbreaking papers, making this his "annus mirabilis,"
                    or miracle year. <br>One of the papers introduces his special theory of relativity and another <i>E =
                        mc
                        <sup>2</sup></i>.</li>

                <li><strong>1907:</strong> Begins applying the laws of gravity to his special theory of relativity.</li>
                <li><strong>1911:</strong> Moves with his family to Prague, where he is given a full professorship at the
                    German University there. <br>Attends the invitation-only Solvay Conference in Brussels, the first world

                <li><strong>1912:</strong> Moves with his family to Zurich, where he becomes a professor of theoretical physics
                    at the ETH.</li>
                <li><strong>1913:</strong> Works on his new theory of gravity.</li>
                <li><strong>1914:</strong> Becomes director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin and professor of theoretical
                    physics at the University of Berlin.</li>
                <li><strong>1915:</strong> Completes the general theory of relativity.</li>
                <li><strong>1917:</strong> Collapses from exhaustion and falls seriously ill. Nursed back to health by his
                    cousin Elsa Löwenthal.<br> Publishes his first paper on cosmology.</li>
                <li><strong>1919:</strong> Marries Löwenthal. On May 29, a solar eclipse provides proof of the general theory

                <li><strong>1928:</strong> Begins pursuing his idea of a unified field theory.</li>
                <li><strong>1932:</strong> As a Jew, begins to feel the heat of Nazi Germany. Now, at 53, at the height of
                    his fame.</li>
